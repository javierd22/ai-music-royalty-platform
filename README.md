# AI Music Royalty Attribution Platform

**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-25

---

## Overview

The AI Music Royalty Attribution Platform is a provenance-first system that ensures artists get paid when AI systems use, are influenced by, or directly reference their music. The platform provides transparent attribution, automatic royalty distribution, and compliance with emerging AI regulations.

## API Documentation

### Artist API

**Base URL:** `http://localhost:8001` (dev) | `https://api.yourdomain.com` (prod)

The Artist API provides secure, per-artist access to tracks, royalties, and claims data. All endpoints require authentication via Supabase JWT tokens.

**Security:**

- All endpoints require valid artist JWT token
- Row Level Security (RLS) enforces artist-only access
- Rate limiting: 60 req/min per artist
- PII redaction in logs per PRD Â§12

#### Authentication

All Artist API requests require a **Bearer token** in the `Authorization` header.

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..." \
     http://localhost:8001/artist/tracks
```

#### Endpoints

**GET /artist/tracks** - Get all tracks owned by the authenticated artist
**GET /artist/royalties** - Get royalty events for artist's tracks
**GET /artist/claims** - Get claims submitted by the artist
**GET /artist/reports** - Generate compliance summary for artist (JSON download)

#### React Hooks

The frontend provides React hooks for easy integration:

```tsx
import {
  useArtistTracks,
  useArtistRoyalties,
  useArtistClaims,
  useArtistReport,
} from '@/lib/hooks/useArtistData';

// Example usage
const { tracks, total, loading, error } = useArtistTracks({
  page: 1,
  pageSize: 50,
});
```

### SDK Integration

```typescript
import { createSDK } from '@ai-music-royalty/sdk';

const sdk = createSDK({
  apiKey: 'your-api-key',
  baseUrl: 'https://api.ai-music-royalty.com',
});

// Begin generation
const generation = await sdk.beginGeneration({
  generatorId: 'suno-v3',
  trackId: 'track-uuid',
  prompt: 'upbeat electronic music',
});

// End generation
await sdk.endGeneration(generation.id, {
  outputId: 'generated-track-123',
});
```

## GDPR Compliance

### Data Protection

- **Revenue Split**: 60% artist, 40% platform
- **Consent Mechanism**: Explicit consent required for each track
- **Revocation Rights**: Artists may revoke consent at any time
- **Attribution**: Complete provenance tracking and audit trails

### Compliance Standards

- **EU AI Act**: Full compliance with Article 52 transparency requirements
- **C2PA Standards**: Cryptographic provenance manifests

- **Vulnerability Management**: Regular security assessments
- **Incident Response**: Documented incident response procedures

### Row Level Security (RLS)

All database queries are filtered by `artist_id` and enforced by Supabase RLS policies:

```sql
-- Artists can only view their own tracks
CREATE POLICY "Artists can view their own tracks" ON tracks
  FOR SELECT USING (artist_id = (SELECT id FROM artists WHERE auth_user_id = auth.uid()));
```

## Development Workflow

1. **Local Development**: Use `npm run dev` for frontend, `python server/main.py` for backend
2. **Testing**: Run `npm test` for frontend tests, `pytest` for backend tests
3. **Deployment**: Follow deployment guides for production deployment
