  "prompts": [
    "At start, open DAILY_TASKS.md. If no section exists for today's date, create one titled 'Daily Tasks â€” YYYY-MM-DD' and populate it using the instructions Javier provided for today.",
    "Each task must include its corresponding role in brackets, e.g. [Role: Backend Engineer]. Use docs/ROLES.md as a reference for each role's conventions and commands.",
    "Work strictly in order from top to bottom of the daily list. Do not skip tasks unless explicitly blocked, in which case record the reason and evidence.",
    "After completing each task, write a short, timestamped note to logs/daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md describing what was done, commands used, outputs, and any follow-up notes.",
    "Run tests after code or configuration changes and resolve any failing results before continuing.",
    "Do not output the end-of-day report until every task is complete or explicitly blocked with a reason.",
    "At the end only, output a markdown block titled 'Daily Summary YYYY-MM-DD' listing all tasks, each with a Done/Blocked state, notes, related commits or PRs, and key evidence links.",
    "Never summarize or output partial progress mid-run. The summary appears only after the full daily checklist is complete."
